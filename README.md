Project Overview:

I am developing a Cpp-based tool designed for creating and customizing self-constructed rules and overriding settings. This tool allows users to tailor their configurations precisely to their needs, providing a robust platform for rule management and customization.

**Key Features:**

* Custom Rule Creation: Users can create their own rules with detailed specifications, offering flexibility and control over their configurations.

* Settings Override: The tool provides the ability to override existing settings, granting users the power to prioritize certain rules or configurations as required.

* **[Warning]** Self-Contained Architecture: In its initial phase, the project is entirely self-contained. This means it is designed to function independently without requiring external feedback or support for issue resolution.

**Development Stage:**
  
* As I am currently in the early stages of development, my focus is on building a strong foundational architecture. During this phase, I am not addressing external feedback or resolving issues outside the scope of my initial design objectives. My goal is to ensure a stable and reliable core before expanding its capabilities.

**Future Prospects:**

* Once the foundational elements are solidified, we plan to explore further enhancements and potentially open the project for broader community involvement, where feedback and collaborative issue resolution could play a role in future iterations.
